abstract = {Human sex chromosomes evolved from autosomes. Nineteen ancestral autosomal genes persist as differentiated homologs on the X and Y chromosomes. The ages of individual X-Y gene pairs (measured by nucleotide divergence) and the locations of their X members on the X chromosome were found to be highly correlated. Age decreased in stepwise fashion from the distal long arm to the distal short arm in at least four 'evolutionary strata.' Human sex chromosome evolution was probably punctuated by at least four events, each suppressing X-Y recombination in one stratum, without disturbing gene order on the X chromosome. The first event, which marked the beginnings of X-Y differentiation, occurred about 240 to 320 million years ago, shortly after divergence of the mammalian and avian lineages.},

abstract = {Sex chromosomes - particularly the human Y - have been a source of fascination for decades because of their unique transmission patterns and their peculiar cytology. The outpouring of genomic data confirms that their atypical structure and gene composition break the rules of genome organization, function, and evolution. The X has been shaped by dosage differences to have a biased gene content and to be subject to inactivation in females. The Y chromosome seems to be a product of a perverse evolutionary process that does not select the fittest Y, which may cause its degradation and ultimate extinction. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Inc.},

Most ({\~{}}75{\%}) anurans have homomorphic sex chromosomes, with XY systems being three times more common than ZW systems. Most remaining anurans ({\~{}}25{\%}) have heteromorphic sex chromosomes, with XY and ZW systems almost equally represented. There are Y-autosome fusions in 11 species, and no W-/Z-/X-autosome fusions are known. The phylogeny represents at least 19 transitions between sex-determination systems and at least 16 cases of independent evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes from homomorphy, the likely ancestral state. Five lineages mostly have heteromorphic sex chromosomes, which might have evolved due to demographic and sexual selection attributes of those lineages. Males do not recombine over most of their genome, regardless of which is the heterogametic sex. Nevertheless, telomere-restricted recombination between ZW chromosomes has evolved at least once. More comparative genomic studies are needed to understand the evolutionary trajectories of sex chromosomes among frog lineages, especially in the ZW systems.},

@article{Devlin2002,
abstract = {A great deal of information is known regarding the process of sex differentiation in fish, and the mechanisms involved in primary sex determination are now beginning to be defined. A range of gonadal differentiation types have been described for fish, including gonochoristic species possessing purely ovarian or testicular tissues, as well as hermaphroditic species that can initially mature either as males (protandrous) or females (protogynous). Sex determination in fish is a very flexible process with respect to evolutionary patterns observed among genera and families, and within individuals is subject to modification by external factors. These influences can affect the fate of both somatic and germ cells within the primordial gonad, and include the action of genetic, environmental (e.g. temperature), behavioural, and physiological factors. Exogenous sex steroids administered at the time of sex determination can strongly influence the course of sex differentiation in fish, suggesting that they play a critical role in assignment of gonad determination as well as subsequent differentiation. Detailed information is available from fish systems describing the production of sex steroids, as well as the enzymes involved in steroid production. Both estradiol and the maturation hormone 17$\alpha$, 20$\beta$-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17$\alpha$, 20$\beta$-DP) are produced by a two-step process involving different cell layers in the gonad, and have effects on the differentiation of gonadal and nongonadal tissues. Gonadal development and differentiation in some fish is also controlled by hormones from the pituitary gland (gonadotropins) that are regulated by release hormones (GnRH) and other neuroendocrine and gonadal factors. Genetic determination of sex in fish can involve monogenic or polygenic systems, with factors located on the autosomes or on sex chromosomes. In the latter case, both male (XY) and female (ZW) heterogametic systems have been described, as well as many subtle variations on these themes. Sex chromosomes are found in approximately 10{\%} of fish species examined, and sex-linked phenotypic traits, and protein and molecular genetic markers have been identified in several fish systems. Some species of fish reproduce gynogenetically, producing all-female populations. Several gene families known to be involved in sex determination in other vertebrates have recently been shown to be similarly involved in fish, suggesting conservation of sex determination pathways. The lability of sex-determination systems in fish makes some species sensitive to environmental pollutants capable of mimicking or disrupting sex hormone actions. Such observations provide important insight into potential impacts from endocrine disruptors, and can provide useful monitoring tools for impacts on aquatic environments. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We tested these two hypotheses in a group of Palearctic green toads that diverged some 3.3 million years ago. Using sibship analyses of sex-linked markers, we show that all four species investigated share the same pair of sex chromosomes and a pattern of male heterogamety with drastically reduced X-Y recombination in males. Phylogenetic analyses of sex-linked sequences show that X and Y alleles cluster by species, not by gametolog.

abstract = {Y chromosomes originate from ordinary autosomes and degenerate by accumulating deleterious mutations. This accumulation results from a lack of recombination on the Y and is driven by interference among deleterious mutations (Muller's ratchet and background selection) and the fixation of beneficial alleles (genetic hitchhiking). Here I show that the relative importance of these processes is expected to vary over the course of Y chromosome evolution due to changes in the number of active genes. The dominant mode of degeneration on a newly formed gene-rich Y chromosome is expected to be Muller's ratchet and/or background selection due to the large numbers of deleterious mutations arising in active genes. However, the relative importance of these modes of degeneration declines rapidly as active genes are lost. In contrast, the rate of degeneration due to hitchhiking is predicted to be highest on Y chromosomes containing an intermediate number of active genes. The temporal dynamics of these processes imply that a gradual restriction of recombination, as inferred in mammals, will increase the importance of genetic hitchhiking relative to Muller's ratchet and background selection.

We also emphasize why accurate estimation of mutation load depends on assumptions regarding the distribution of dominance and selection coefficients-quantities that remain poorly characterized for current genomic data sets.},

It is shown that the Y chromosome can gradually lose its genetic activity due to the fixation of deleterious mutations that are linked with other beneficial genes. Fixation of deleterious Y-linked mutations generates locus-specific selection for dosage tolerance and/or compensation. The hitchhiking effect is most pronounced when operating in combination with an alternative model, Muller's ratchet.

An alternative model is proposed, which is based on the principle of Muller's ratchet; this involves the accumulation of chromosomes bearing deleterious mutant genes in a finite population in the absence of crossing-over. This process would result in the gradual increase, with time, in the number of mutant loci carried in an average Y chromosome, although the frequency of individual deleterious alleles at most loci remains low. It is shown that this creates a selection pressure for differentially increasing the activity of the X chromosome in heterogametic individuals at the expense of that of the Y, leading eventually to a genetically inert Y chromosome and to the evolution of dosage compensation.},

However, despite these bottlenecks, they seem to avoid fitness declines that can result from Muller's ratchet. In addition, founder effects that occur during the geographic introductions of human-amplified arboviruses, including chikungunya virus and Zika virus, can affect epidemic and endemic circulation, as well as virulence.

abstract = {Selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation may cause a reduction in the amount of genetic variability at linked neutral sites. This is because a new neutral variant can only remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction below classical neutral values resulting from such background selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity, and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the genome involved. Simulations show that the effect decreases rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of outcrossing. The mean time to loss of new neutral mutations and the total number of segregating neutral sites are less sensitive to background selection than the other statistics, unless the population size is of the order of a hundred thousand or more. The stationary distribution of allele frequencies at the neutral sites is correspondingly skewed in favor of rare alleles, compared with the classical neutral result. Observed reductions in molecular variation in low recombination genomic regions of sufficiently large size, for instance in the centromere-proximal regions of Drosophila autosomes or in highly selfing plant populations, may be partly due to background selection against deleterious mutations.},

abstract = {Peripatric speciation is a mode of speciation in which a new species is formed from an isolated peripheral population. [1]:105 Since peripatric speciation resembles allopatric speciation, in that populations are isolated and prevented from exchanging genes, it can often be difficult to distinguish between them. [2] Nevertheless, the primary characteristic of peripatric speciation proposes that one of the populations is much smaller than the other. The terms peripatric and peripatry are often used in biogeography, referring to organisms whose ranges are closely adjacent but do not overlap, being separated where these organisms do not occur-for example on an oceanic island compared to the mainland. Such organisms are usually closely related (e.g. sister species); their distribution being the result of peripatric speciation. The concept of peripatric speciation was first outlined by the evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr in 1954. [3] Since then, other alternative models have been developed such as centrifugal speciation, that posits that a species' population experiences periods of geographic range expansion followed by shrinking periods, leaving behind small isolated populations on the periphery of the main population. Other models have involved the effects of sexual selection on limited population sizes. Other related models of peripherally isolated populations based on chromo-somal rearrangements have been developed such as budding speciation and quantum speciation.},

abstract = {Genomic analysis of many nonmodel species has uncovered an incredible diversity of sex chromosome systems, making it possible to empirically test the rich body of evolutionary theory that describes each stage of sex chromosome evolution. Classic theory predicts that sex chromosomes originate from a pair of homologous autosomes and recombination between them is suppressed via inversions to resolve sexual conflict. The resulting degradation of the Y chromosome gene content creates the need for dosage compensation in the heterogametic sex. Sex chromosome theory also implies a linear process, starting from sex chromosome origin and progressing to heteromorphism. Despite many convergent genomic patterns exhibited by independently evolved sex chromosome systems, and many case studies supporting these theoretical predictions, emerging data provide numerous interesting exceptions to these long-standing theories, and suggest that the remarkable diversity of sex chromosomes is matched by a similar diversity in their evolution. For example, it is clear that sex chromosome pairs are not always derived from homologous autosomes. In addition, both the cause and the mechanism of recombination suppression between sex chromosome pairs remain unclear, and it may be that the spread of recombination suppression is a more gradual process than previously thought. It is also clear that dosage compensation can be achieved in many ways, and displays a range of efficacy in different systems. Finally, the remarkable turnover of sex chromosomes in many systems, as well as variation in the rate of sex chromosome divergence, suggest that assumptions about the inevitable linearity of sex chromosome evolution are not always empirically supported, and the drivers of the birth-death cycle of sex chromosome evolution remain to be elucidated. Here, we concentrate on how the diversity in sex chromosomes across taxa highlights an equal diversity in each stage of sex chromosome evolution.},

@article{joly2011existence,
abstract = {Background: Speciation corresponds to the progressive establishment of reproductive barriers between groups of individuals derived from an ancestral stock. Since Darwin did not believe that reproductive barriers could be selected for, he proposed that most events of speciation would occur through a process of separation and divergence, and this point of view is still shared by most evolutionary biologists today.Results: I do, however, contend that, if so much speciation occurs, the most likely explanation is that there must be conditions where reproductive barriers can be directly selected for. In other words, situations where it is advantageous for individuals to reproduce preferentially within a small group and reduce their breeding with the rest of the ancestral population. This leads me to propose a model whereby new species arise not by populations splitting into separate branches, but by small inbreeding groups "budding" from an ancestral stock. This would be driven by several advantages of inbreeding, and mainly by advantageous recessive phenotypes, which could only be retained in the context of inbreeding. Reproductive barriers would thus not arise as secondary consequences of divergent evolution in populations isolated from one another, but under the direct selective pressure of ancestral stocks. Many documented cases of speciation in natural populations appear to fit the model proposed, with more speciation occurring in populations with high inbreeding coefficients, and many recessive characters identified as central to the phenomenon of speciation, with these recessive mutations expected to be surrounded by patterns of limited genomic diversity.Conclusions: Whilst adaptive evolution would correspond to gains of function that would, most of the time, be dominant, this type of speciation by budding would thus be driven by mutations resulting in the advantageous loss of certain functions since recessive mutations very often correspond to the inactivation of a gene. A very important further advantage of inbreeding is that it reduces the accumulation of recessive mutations in genomes. A consequence of the model proposed is that the existence of species would correspond to a metastable equilibrium between inbreeding and outbreeding, with excessive inbreeding promoting speciation, and excessive outbreeding resulting in irreversible accumulation of recessive mutations that could ultimately only lead to extinction.Reviewer names: Eugene V.

abstract = {Analyses of Y chromosome haplotypes uniquely provide a paternal picture of evolutionary histories and offer a very useful contrast to studies based on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Here we used a bioinformatic approach based on comparison of male and female sequence coverage to identify 4.7 Mb from the grey wolf (Canis lupis) Y chromosome, probably representing most of the male-specific, nonampliconic sequence from the euchromatic part of the chromosome. We characterized this sequence and then identified ≈1,500 Y-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms in a sample of 145 resequenced male wolves, including 75 Finnish wolf genomes newly sequenced in this study, and in 24 dogs and eight other canids. We found 53 Y chromosome haplotypes, of which 26 were seen in grey wolves, that clustered in four major haplogroups. All four haplogroups were represented in samples of Finnish wolves, showing that haplogroup lineages were not partitioned on a continental scale. However, regional population structure was indicated because individual haplotypes were never shared between geographically distant areas, and genetically similar haplotypes were only found within the same geographical region. The deepest split between grey wolf haplogroups was estimated to have occurred 125,000 years ago, which is considerably older than recent estimates of the time of divergence of wolf populations. The distribution of dogs in a phylogenetic tree of Y chromosome haplotypes supports multiple domestication events, or wolf paternal introgression, starting 29,000 years ago. We also addressed the disputed origin of a recently founded population of Scandinavian wolves and observed that founding as well as most recent immigrant haplotypes were present in the neighbouring Finnish population, but not in sequenced wolves from elsewhere in the world, or in dogs.},

abstract = {The method of calculation is shown wherebt a formula has been derived that approximately the ratio of the rate of accumulation of advantageous mutant genes in a population that undergoes recombination to the rate in an otherwise non-recombining one. A table is given showing the ratios thus found for different frequencies of advantageous mutations and different degrees of their advantage. It is shown that this calculation does not apply for mutant genes that act advantageously only when in some special combinations with one or more other mutant genes, and that as far as these cases of special synergism are concerned recombining lines have no evolutionary advantage over non-recombining ones. Other limitations of the formula are pointed out and assessed. It is explained that most factors that retard the rate of recombination-for expample, linkage, rarity of outbreeding, intercalation of sexual reproduction between more frequent cycles of sexual propagation, and partial isolation between subpopulations-must usually cause little long-term retardation of the speed of advance that is fostered by recombination. Moreover, even where long-term evolutions has virtually ceased, recombination of mutant genes still confers upon a population the means of adopting short-term genetic "dodges", that adjust it to ecological and "physical" changes in its circumstances, much more rapidly than would be possible for a comparable asexual population. Under conditions where only stability of type is needed, a non-recombining does not actually degenerate as a result of an excess of mutation over selection, after the usual equilibrium between these pressures is reached. However, a irreversible ratchet mechanism exists in the non-recombining species (unlike the recombining ones) that prevents selection, even if intensified, from reducing the mutational loads below the lightest that were in existence when the intensified selection started, whereas, contrariwise, "drift", and what might be called "selective noise" must allow occasional slips of the lightest loads in the direction of increased weight. {\textcopyright} 1964.},

Half a century later, we more fully appreciate what a huge challenge it is to replicate six billion nucleotides with the accuracy needed to stably maintain the human genome over many generations. This challenge is perhaps greater than was realized 50 years ago, because subsequent studies have revealed that the genome can be destabilized not only by environmental stresses that generate a large number and variety of potentially cytotoxic and mutagenic lesions in DNA but also by various sequence motifs of normal DNA that present challenges to replication. Towards a better understanding of the many determinants of genome stability, this chapter reviews the fidelity with which undamaged and damaged DNA is copied, with a focus on the eukaryotic B- and Y-family DNA polymerases, and considers how this fidelity is achieved. {\textcopyright}2008 IBCB, SIBS, CAS.

In fact, males and females are determined by diverse mechanisms that evolve rapidly in many taxa. Yet this diversity in primary sex-determining signals is coupled with conserved molecular pathways that trigger male or female development. Conflicting selection on different parts of the genome and on the two sexes may drive many of these transitions, but few systems with rapid turnover of sex determination mechanisms have been rigorously studied.

abstract = {In this chapter the different categories of homomorphic and heteromorphic sex chromosomes, types of sex-determining mechanisms, known sex-linked genes, and data about sex-determining genes in the Amphibia have been compiled. Thorough cytogenetic analyses have shown that both XY/XX and ZW/ZZ sex chromosomes exist in the order Anura and Urodela. In some species quite unusual systems of sex determination have evolved (e.g. 0W-females/00-males or the co-existence of XY/XX and ZW/ZZ sex chromosomes within the same species). In the third order of the Amphibia, the Gymnophiona (or Apoda) there is still no information regarding any aspect of sex determination. Whereas most species of Anura and Urodela present undifferentiated, homomorphic sex chromosomes, there is also a considerable number of species in which an increasing structural complexity of the Y and W chromosomes exists. In various cases, the morphological differentiation of the sex chromosomes occurred as a result of quantitative and/or qualitative changes to the repetitive DNA sequences in the constitutive heterochromatin of the Y and W chromosomes. The greater the structural differences between the sex chromosomes, the lesser the extent of pairing in meiosis. No dosage compensation of the sex-linked genes in the somatic cells of the homogametic (XX or ZZ) individuals have been detected. The genes located to date on the amphibian sex chromosomes lead to the conclusion that there is no common ancestral or conserved sex-linkage group. In all amphibians, genetic sex determination (GSD) seems to operate, although environmental factors may influence sex determination and differentiation. Despite the accumulated evidence that GSD is operating in Anura and Urodela, there is little substantial information about how it functions. Although several DNA sequences homologous to the mammalian ZFY, SRY and SOX genes have been detected in the Anura or Urodela, none of these genes is an appropriate candidate to explain sex determination in these vertebrates.},

In particular, the dynamics of the sex-determining region (SDR) have been demonstrated by recent findings in ancient and incipient sex chromosomes. Radical changes in genomic structure and gene content in the male specific region of the Y chromosome between human and chimpanzee indicated rapid evolution in the past 6 million years, defying the notion that the pace of evolution in the SDR was fast at early stages but slowed down overtime. The chicken Z and the human X chromosomes appeared to have acquired testis-expressed genes and expanded in intergenic regions. Transposable elements greatly contributed to SDR expansion and aided the trafficking of genes in the SDR and its X or Z counterpart through retrotransposition. Dosage compensation is not a destined consequence of sex chromosomes as once thought. Most X-linked microRNA genes escape silencing and are expressed in testis. Collectively, these findings are challenging many of our preconceived ideas of the evolutionary trajectory and fates of sex chromosomes. {\textcopyright}2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {According to the canonical model of sex-chromosome evolution, the degeneration of Y or W chromosomes (as observed in mammals and birds, respectively) results from an arrest of recombination in the heterogametic sex, driven by the fixation of sexually antagonistic mutations. However, sex chromosomes have remained homomorphic in many lineages of fishes, amphibians, and nonavian reptiles. According to the "fountain-of-youth" model, this homomorphy results from occasional events of sex reversal. If recombination arrest in males is controlled by maleness per se (and not by genotype), then Y chromosomes are expected to recombine in XY females, preventing their long-term degeneration. Here, we provide field support for the fountain-of-youth, by showing that sex-chromosome recombination in Rana temporaria only depends on phenotypic sex: naturally occurring XX males show the same restriction of recombination as XY males (average map length ∼ 2 cM), while XY females recombine as much as XX females (average map length ∼ 150 cM). Our results challenge several common assumptions regarding the evolution of sex chromosomes, including the role of sexually antagonistic genes as drivers of recombination arrest, and that of chromosomal inversions as underlying mechanisms.},

abstract = {Non-recombining sex chromosomes are expected to undergo evolutionary decay, ending up genetically degenerated, as has happened in birds and mammals. Why are then sex chromosomes so often homomorphic in cold-blooded vertebrates? One possible explanation is a high rate of turnover events, replacing master sex-determining genes by new ones on other chromosomes. An alternative is that X-Y similarity is maintained by occasional recombination events, occurring in sex-reversed XY females. Based on mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences, we estimated the divergence times between European tree frogs (Hyla arborea, H. intermedia, and H. molleri) to the upper Miocene, about 5.4-7.1 million years ago. Sibship analyses of microsatellite polymorphisms revealed that all three species have the same pair of sex chromosomes, with complete absence of X-Y recombination in males. Despite this, sequences of sex-linked loci show no divergence between the X and Y chromosomes. In the phylogeny, the X and Y alleles cluster according to species, not in groups of gametologs. We conclude that sex-chromosome homomorphy in these tree frogs does not result from a recent turnover but is maintained over evolutionary timescales by occasional X-Y recombination. Seemingly young sex chromosomes may thus carry old-established sex-determining genes, a result at odds with the view that sex chromosomes necessarily decay until they are replaced. This raises intriguing perspectives regarding the evolutionary dynamics of sexually antagonistic genes and the mechanisms that control X-Y recombination. {\textcopyright}2011 St{\"{o}}ck et al.},

This complexity is partly based on the need to remove or tolerate cytotoxic and mutagenic lesions in DNA generated by environmental stress. Considered here is the fidelity with which undamaged and damaged DNA is replicated by the many DNA polymerases now known to exist. Some of these seriously violate Watson-Crick base-pairing rules such that, depending on the polymerase, the composition and location of the error, and the ability to correct errors (or not), DNA synthesis error rates can vary by more than a millionfold. This offers the potential to modulate rates of point mutations over a wide range, with consequences that can be either deleterious or beneficial. {\textcopyright}2009 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {In birds, as in mammals, one pair of chromosomes differs between the sexes. In birds, males are ZZ and females ZW. In mammals, males are XY and females XX. Like the mammalian XY pair, the avian ZW pair is believed to have evolved from autosomes, with most change occurring in the chromosomes found in only one sexĝ€"the W and Y chromosomes. By contrast, the sex chromosomes found in both sexesĝ€"the Z and X chromosomesĝ€" are assumed to have diverged little from their autosomal progenitors. Here we report findings that challenge this assumption for both the chicken Z chromosome and the human X chromosome. The chicken Z chromosome, which we sequenced essentially to completion, is less gene-dense than chicken autosomes but contains a massive tandem array containing hundreds of duplicated genes expressed in testes. A comprehensive comparison of the chicken Z chromosome with the finished sequence of the human X chromosome demonstrates that each evolved independently from different portions of the ancestral genome. Despite this independence, the chicken Z and human X chromosomes share features that distinguish them from autosomes: the acquisition and amplification of testis-expressed genes, and a low gene density resulting from an expansion of intergenic regions. These features were not present on the autosomes from which the Z and X chromosomes originated but were instead acquired during the evolution of Z and X as sex chromosomes. We conclude that the avian Z and mammalian X chromosomes followed convergent evolutionary trajectories, despite their evolving with opposite (female versus male) systems of heterogamety. More broadly, in birds and mammals, sex chromosome evolution involved not only gene loss in sex-specific chromosomes, but also marked expansion and gene acquisition in sex chromosomes common to males and females. {\textcopyright}2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Previously, expensive and labor-intensive BAC-based techniques were used to sequence the Y for a handful of mammalian species. Here, we present a much faster and more affordable strategy for sequencing and assembling mammalian Y Chromosomes of sufficient quality for most comparative genomics analyses and for conservation genetics applications. The strategy combines flow sorting, short- and long-read genome and transcriptome sequencing, and droplet digital PCR with novel and existing computational methods. It can be used to reconstruct sex chromosomes in a heterogametic sex of any species. We applied our strategy to produce a draft of the gorilla Y sequence. The resulting assembly allowed us to refine gene content, evaluate copy number of ampliconic gene families, locate species-specific palindromes, examine the repetitive element content, and produce sequence alignments with human and chimpanzee Y Chromosomes. Our results inform the evolution of the hominine (human, chimpanzee, and gorilla) Y Chromosomes. Surprisingly, we found the gorilla Y Chromosome to be similar to the human Y Chromosome, but not to the chimpanzee Y Chromosome. Moreover, we have utilized the assembled gorilla Y Chromosome sequence to design genetic markers for studying the male-specific dispersal of this endangered species.},

Even at this early stage, however, there is evidence that males and females respond to environmental stimuli differently, and the divergent phenotypic responses may have consequences later in life. The effect of prenatal nutrient restriction illustrates this point, as adult women exposed to prenatal restrictions exhibited increased risk factors of cardiovascular disease, while men exposed to the same condition did not. Recent research has examined the roles of sex-specific genes, hormones, chromosomes, and the interactions among them in mediating sex-biased phenotypes. Such research has identified testosterone, for example, as a possible protective agent against autoimmune disorders and an XX chromosome complement as a susceptibility factor in murine models of lupus and multiple sclerosis. Sex-biased chromatin is an additional and likely important component. Research suggesting a role for X and Y chromosome heterochromatin in regulating epigenetic states of autosomes has highlighted unorthodox mechanisms of gene regulation. The crosstalk between the Y chromosomes and autosomes may be further mediated by the mitochondria. The organelles have solely maternal transmission and exert differential effects on males and females. Altogether, research supports the notion that the interaction between sex-biased elements might exert novel regulatory functions in the genome and contribute to sex-specific susceptibilities to autoimmune and neurological diseases.},

abstract = {The male-specific region of the Y chromosome, the MSY, differentiates the sexes and comprises 95{\%} of the chromosome's length. Here, we report that the MSY is a mosaic of heterochromatic sequences and three classes of euchromatic sequences: X-transposed, X-degenerate and ampliconic. These classes contain all 156 known transcription units, which include 78 protein-coding genes that collectively encode 27 distinct proteins. The X-transposed sequences exhibit 99{\%} identity to the X chromosome. The X-degenerate sequences are remnants of ancient autosomes from which the modern X and Y chromosomes evolved. The ampliconic class includes large regions (about 30{\%} of the MSY euchromatin) where sequence pairs show greater than 99.9{\%} identity, which is maintained by frequent gene conversion (non-reciprocal transfer). The most prominent features here are eight massive palindromes, at least six of which contain testis genes.},

abstract = {Nonrecombining Y chromosomes are expected to degenerate through the progressive accumulation of deleterious mutations. In lower vertebrates, however, most species display homomorphic sex chromosomes. To address this, paradox I propose a role for sex reversal, which occasionally occurs in ectotherms due to the general dependence of physiological processes on temperature. Because sex-specific recombination patterns depend on phenotypic, rather than genotypic sex, homomorphic X and Y chromosomes are expected to recombine in sex-reversed females. These rare events should generate bursts of new Y haplotypes, which will be quickly sorted out by natural or sexual selection. By counteracting Muller's ratchet, this regular purge should prevent the evolutionary decay of Y chromosomes. I review empirical data supporting this suggestion, and propose further investigations for testing it. {\textcopyright}2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

abstract = {Y chromosomes underlie sex determination in mammals, but their repeat-rich nature has hampered sequencing and associated evolutionary studies. Here we trace Y evolution across 15 representative mammals on the basis of high-throughput genome and transcriptome sequencing. We uncover three independent sex chromosome originations in mammals and birds (the outgroup). The original placental and marsupial (therian) Y, containing the sex-determining gene SRY, emerged in the therian ancestor approximately 180 million years ago, in parallel with the first of five monotreme Y chromosomes, carrying the probable sex-determining gene AMH. The avian W chromosome arose approximately 140 million years ago in the bird ancestor. The small Y/W gene repertoires, enriched in regulatory functions, were rapidly defined following stratification (recombination arrest) and erosion events and have remained considerably stable. Despite expression decreases in therians, Y/W genes show notable conservation of proto-sex chromosome expression patterns, although various Y genes evolved testis-specificities through differential regulatory decay. Thus, although some genes evolved novel functions through spatial/temporal expression shifts, most Y genes probably endured, at least initially, because of dosage constraints. {\textcopyright}2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {A typical pattern in sex chromosome evolution is that Y chromosomes are small and have lost many of their genes. One mechanism that might explain the degeneration of Y chromosomes is Muller's ratchet, the perpetual stochastic loss of linkage groups carrying the fewest number of deleterious mutations. This process has been investigated theoretically mainly for asexual, haploid populations. Here, I construct a model of a sexual population where deleterious mutations arise on both X and Y chromosomes. Simulation results of this model demonstrate that mutations on the X chromosome can considerably slow down the ratchet. On the other hand, a lower mutation rate in females than in males, background selection, and the emergence of dosage compensation are expected to accelerate the process.

@article{templeton1980theory,
abstract = {The founder principle has been used to explain many instances of rapid speciation. Advances from theoretical population genetics are incorporated into MAYR's original founder-effect genetic-revolution model to yield a newer model called the genetic transilience. The basic theoretical edifice lies upon the fact that founder event can sometimes lead to an accumulation of inbreeding and an induction of gametic disequilibrium. This, in turn, causes alleles to be selected more for their homozygous fitness effects and for their effects on a more stable genetic background. Selection occurring in multi-locus systems controlling integrated developmental, physiological, behavioral, etc., traits is particularly sensitive to these founder effects. If sufficient genetic variability exists in the founder population, such multilocus genetic systems can respond to drift and the altered selective forces by undergoing a rapid shift to a new adaptive peak known as the genetic transilience. A genetic transilience is, therefore, most likely to occur when the founder event causes a rapid accumulation of inbreeding without a severe reduction in genetic variability. The implications of this model are then examined for three aspects of the founder-effect genetic-transilience model: the attributes of the ancestral population, the nature of the sampling process used to generate the founders and the attributes of the founder population. The model is used to explain several features of the evolution of the Hawaiian Drosophila, and experimental designs are outlined to test the major predictions of the theroy. Hence, this theory of speciation can be tested in the laboratory, using systems and techniques that already exist - a rare attribute of most models of speciation.},

abstract = {The human X and Y chromosomes evolved from an ordinary pair of autosomes during the past 200-300 million years. The human MSY (male-specific region of Y chromosome) retains only three percent of the ancestral autosomes' genes owing to genetic decay. This evolutionary decay was driven by a series of five 'stratification' events. Each event suppressed X-Y crossing over within a chromosome segment or 'stratum', incorporated that segment into the MSY and subjected its genes to the erosive forces that attend the absence of crossing over. The last of these events occurred 30 million years ago, 5 million years before the human and Old World monkey lineages diverged. Although speculation abounds regarding ongoing decay and looming extinction of the human Y chromosome, remarkably little is known about how many MSY genes were lost in the human lineage in the 25 million years that have followed its separation from the Old World monkey lineage. To investigate this question, we sequenced the MSY of the rhesus macaque, an Old World monkey, and compared it to the human MSY. We discovered that during the last 25 million years MSY gene loss in the human lineage was limited to the youngest stratum (stratum 5), which comprises three percent of the human MSY. In the older strata, which collectively comprise the bulk of the human MSY, gene loss evidently ceased more than 25 million years ago. Likewise, the rhesus MSY has not lost any older genes (from strata 1-4) during the past 25 million years, despite its major structural differences to the human MSY. The rhesus MSY is simpler, with few amplified gene families or palindromes that might enable intrachromosomal recombination and repair. We present an empirical reconstruction of human MSY evolution in which each stratum transitioned from rapid, exponential loss of ancestral genes to strict conservation through purifying selection. {\textcopyright}2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
